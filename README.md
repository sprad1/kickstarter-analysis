**Kickstarting with Excel - Written Analysis of the Results**

## Overview of Project

    ### Purpose: - The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise, an up-and-coming playwright looking to crowdfund her project by determining if there were specific factors that make a prject campaign successful.
    
## Analysis and Challenges
    
    ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
        Using the Kickstarter data set, pivot table was created on a new sheet titled, "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date." As only the theater data was needed, the pivot table was filtered accordingly and by years as well. The pivot table and pivot chart display data for plays based on their success, failure and cancelation as well as the month in which they were most successful, unsuccessful and canceled. 


    ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Using the Kickstarter data set, a new sheet titled, "Outcomes Based on Goals" was created to display the number of succesfful, failed, and canceled plays that were able to reach their funding goal amount. After determing how many plays were able to reach their goal amount, percentage of that data was calculated as well.

    ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
        One of the biggest challenges I encountered was entering the correct function for each cell due to the repetitiveness and different ranges used in "Outcomes Based on Goals." Another was when creating pivot table and how to set up the PivotChart fields to make the most sense out of the data.
