## Kickstarting with Excel - Written Analysis of the Results**

### Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise, an up-and-coming playwright looking to crowdfund her project by determining if there were specific factors that make a project campaign successful.
    
### Analysis and Challenges
    
  #### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the Kickstarter data set, pivot table was created on a new sheet titled, "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date." As only the theater data was needed, the pivot table was filtered accordingly and by years as well. The pivot table and pivot chart display data for plays based on their success, failure and cancelation as well as the month in which they were most successful, unsuccessful and canceled. The blue line is for those plays that were successful, orange line is for plays that were a failure and grey line for plays that were canceled. Analyzing the data based on pivot chart below helps Louise get a beter idea of which months would be successful for her project campaign.

  #### Outcomes Based on Goals

Using the Kickstarter data set, a new sheet titled, "Outcomes Based on Goals" was created to display the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays that were able to reach their funding goal amount. After determing how many plays were able to reach their goal amount, percentage of that data was calculated as well. As with other pivot chart titled, "Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date", the blue line below represents successful plays, orange line represents plays that were a failure, and grey line represents canceled plays. The grey line is a bit hard to visualize as the number of canceled plays that were able o reach their goal was 0. Analyzing the data based on the pivot chart below helps Louise determine what percentage of successful, failed, or canceled plays were able to reach their goal-maount for the play.

  #### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  
One of the biggest challenges I encountered was entering the correct function for each cell due to the repetitiveness and different ranges used in "Outcomes Based on Goals." Another was when creating pivot table and how to set up the PivotChart fields to make the most sense out of the data.

### Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

When analyzing the "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" pivot chart, we can conclude that when plays are launch in the month of May, they are most successful and that there weren't any plays that were canceled in the month of October. For number of plays that were successful, there were still plays that failed or were canceled respectively. For the month of December, the number of plays that were successful and failed are very close. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

From "Outcome based on Goal" pivot chart, we can conclude that none of the canceled plays were able to reach their goal amount before getting canceled. Interestingly, we are able to see that the data for successful and canceled plays based on their goals are opposite from each other and provide a design on some sort.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There were still some plays that were live meaning we didn't have data for them letting us know if they were successful, failure or canceled. Some plays were active longer than others. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create bar graphs as well but I believe line graph does a better job of displaying the data and shows the change over short and long periods of time.
